About

Hyper Lighting adds new and sometimes useful light sources to Minecraft. It was originally created to just add a single torch to the game that could be turned on and off. It has since involved into a much bigger mod and it now even adds colored lighting to the game with the help of addon mods.
 
Light Sources (Read the [WIKI HERE](https://hyperlighting.hypherionmc.me/): 

The light sources added by this mod includes:
 

    Torches that can be turned on and off (based on the Default Minecraft Torches)
