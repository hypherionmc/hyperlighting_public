# Hyper Lighting
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypherionmc/hyperlighting_public/master/wiki_images/hyper_lighting.png)  

Hyper Lighting adds new light sources to Minecraft. This mod is only available for Java Edition 1.12.2 and Forge 1.12.2-14.23.5.2847 and above.

The light sources added by this mod includes:

* [Torches](https://github.com/hypherionmc/hyperlighting_public/wiki/Advanced-Torches) that can be turned on and off (based on the Default Minecraft Torches)
* [Lanterns](https://github.com/hypherionmc/hyperlighting_public/wiki/Advanced-Lanterns) that can be turned on and off
* [Tiki Torches](https://github.com/hypherionmc/hyperlighting_public/wiki/Tiki-Torches) (cause why not)
* [Underwater Lanterns](https://github.com/hypherionmc/hyperlighting_public/wiki/Underwater-Lanterns-and-Torches-(Soul-Fire)) (Yes they work underwater. Why? Spongebob makes campfires underwater and you wanna ask me why??)
* [Underwater Torches](https://github.com/hypherionmc/hyperlighting_public/wiki/Underwater-Lanterns-and-Torches-(Soul-Fire))  

All the light sources added by this mod (Excluding the Underwater Torch and Lantern), come in 5 different colors. The colors include Red, Green, Blue, Orange (Default) and Purple. They, unfortunately, do not emit colored light, as Mojang wants to be a pain in the ass and make it nearly impossible to do that. (Yes I know it's possible, but for that, you need to sacrifice a virgin, sell your soul to the devil, learn 25 years of java and ASM and some other stuff I can't remember now).
